- **Verification Process**: Email confirmation + payment verification
- **One Per Person**: Fraud detection to prevent multiple signups

- **Public Display**: Founder number shown on profile (optional, user can hide)

### 🎮 **Gamification & Psychology**

#### **Scarcity & Urgency Tactics**

- **Recent Activity**: "Sarah just claimed Founder spot #148!"
- **Progress Bar**: Visual progress toward 200 limit
- **Countdown Timer**: "Founders Program ends in 23 days"
- **Social Proof**: Testimonials from existing founders

#### **FOMO Amplification**
- **Limited Time Messaging**: "Once we hit 200, this offer disappears forever"

- **Community Buzz**: Founder discussions visible to non-founders
- **Referral Rewards**: Extra bonuses for founders who refer other founders
