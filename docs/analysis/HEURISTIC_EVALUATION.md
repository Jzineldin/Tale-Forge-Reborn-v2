# Heuristic Evaluation of the AI Pipeline Flow

## 1. Visibility of System Status
- **Good:** The "Easy Mode" and "Advanced Mode" both provide clear step-by-step progress indicators, keeping the user informed of their location within the flow.
- **Good:** Loading states are used during story generation, providing feedback that the system is working.
- **Opportunity:** For the "Advanced Mode," the number of steps (5) could be daunting. A more detailed progress bar showing all step names at once might reduce cognitive load.

## 2. Match Between System and the Real World
- **Good:** The language used ("Genre," "Character," "Setting") is familiar and easy to understand.
- **Good:** The "Easy Mode" simplifies concepts like story length into understandable terms ("short," "medium," "long").

## 3. User Control and Freedom
- **Good:** The user can navigate forwards and backward in both the "Easy" and "Advanced" modes.
- **Good:** The initial mode selection offers a clear "exit" for users who might want to start over or choose a different path.
- **Potential Issue:** In the "Template Mode," the user is taken directly to the final review step. If they want to make a small tweak to the template, they have no option to do so and must start over in "Advanced Mode."

## 4. Consistency and Standards
- **Good:** The overall layout and button styles appear consistent across the different creation flows.
- **Inconsistency:** The existence of `CreateStoryPage.tsx` and `CreateStoryPageTemplate.tsx` suggests a potential for multiple, slightly different UI patterns for the same task. The primary component, `CreateStoryPage.tsx`, consolidates the flows, which is good, but the older file could be a source of future confusion for developers.

## 5. Error Prevention
- **Good:** The "Advanced Mode" includes validation at each step, preventing the user from moving forward with incomplete or invalid data.
- **Good:** Buttons are disabled until the required information is provided, guiding the user towards the correct action.

## 6. Recognition Rather Than Recall
- **Good:** The "Advanced Mode" breaks down the complex task of story creation into smaller, manageable steps, reducing the user's memory load.
- **Opportunity:** The "Easy Mode" could benefit from showing a summary of the user's choices from previous steps.

## 7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
- **Excellent:** The three distinct modes ("Easy," "Template," "Advanced") provide a high degree of flexibility, catering to users with different levels of experience and goals. This is a strong point of the design.

## 8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
- **Good:** The UI is clean and visually appealing, with a clear focus on the task at hand.
- **Opportunity:** The error messages, while functional, could be more visually integrated into the design to feel less like a system alert and more like a helpful guide.

## 9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors
- **Good:** Validation errors are clearly displayed, telling the user what needs to be fixed.
- **Good:** In case of an API error during generation, a generic error message is displayed.
- **Opportunity:** The API error message could be more specific. For example, if the error is due to a content filter, the message could suggest that the user revise their input.

## 10. Help and Documentation
- **Good:** The UI is largely self-explanatory.
- **Opportunity:** Small tooltips or help icons could be added to explain more complex concepts, such as "Atmosphere" or "Moral Lesson" in the "Advanced Mode."
