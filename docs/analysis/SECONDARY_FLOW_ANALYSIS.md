# Secondary User Flow Analysis

## User Authentication (Sign Up/Sign In)

### Summary of Steps
1.  **Entry Point:** The user navigates to `/signin` or `/signup`.
2.  **Method Selection:** The user can choose between email/password, Google, or GitHub for authentication.
3.  **Email/Password:**
    *   **Sign Up:** The user provides their name, email, and password. Client-side validation checks for password length and matching confirmation. A success message prompts the user to check their email for verification.
    *   **Sign In:** The user enters their email and password. Upon success, they are redirected to the `/dashboard`.
4.  **OAuth (Google/GitHub):**
    *   The user clicks the respective button, initiating the OAuth flow.
    *   Upon successful authentication with the provider, the user is redirected back to the application, presumably to the `/dashboard`.
5.  **Error Handling:** Clear error messages are displayed for issues like incorrect credentials, failed OAuth attempts, or validation errors.

### Critical Heuristic Findings
*   **Flexibility and Efficiency of Use:** The inclusion of both email/password and OAuth providers is excellent, catering to different user preferences.
*   **Error Prevention:** The sign-up form includes basic client-side validation, which helps prevent common errors.
*   **Visibility of System Status:** The sign-up form provides a success message, but it might not be clear to the user that they need to verify their email to complete the process. This could be improved with more explicit instructions.
*   **Consistency:** The visual design and layout are consistent between the sign-in and sign-up pages.

## Story Management (View/Delete Stories)

### Summary of Steps
The `StoryLibraryPage.tsx` component at `/stories/library` is intended to be the central hub for users to view, manage, and interact with their created stories.

### Critical Heuristic Findings
*   **Status:** This feature is currently **not implemented**. The page displays a "Coming Soon" message. As a result, a heuristic evaluation cannot be performed. The key takeaway is that while the story *creation* and *reading* flows are functional, the user currently has no way to manage their collection of stories after they are created. This represents a significant gap in the user lifecycle.
