- teaser: A 2-3 sentence description that hooks the reader and features ${childName} as the main character
- hiddenMoral: The life lesson or value taught (not obvious to the child)

Requirements:
- Make ${childName} the main protagonist 
- Create a completely original story concept
- Ensure age-appropriate, inclusive, and positive content
- Be creative and avoid common tropes
